Refer to Secret Hitlerâ€™s official website for rules on how to play.

Getting into a game:

Simply head to the URL, create an account/sign in, and create/join a game. Once there are at least 5 players in a lobby and all players are ready, the host can start the game.

Order of play:

Once the game starts, your role will be revealed to you, and random player will start as the first president. The president will then nominate a chancellor, after which all players will vote to elect these two nominees. 

If the vote passes, the president will be shown the top 3 policies. They will select a policy to discard, in which the chancellor will select one of the remaining two policies to enact.

If the government vote fails 3 times in a row, the top policy will be automatically enacted. To make the game spicy and more fun, if the policy was fascist, the last enacted president gets to play that policy (i.e., vote fails 3 times, the last president with a passing vote gets to kill, investigate, or select the next president)

When there are 5 fascist policies enacted, veto powers are unlocked. If the chancellor wishes to veto, and the president agrees, the chancellor can select the veto button to discard all cards. If the president doesn't agree, the chancellor must select a policy to enact.

When a team has won, players can either leave the lobby or play again with the same group.
